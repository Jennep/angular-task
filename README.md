# EnerkeyCodingTask

Implement methods that sort persons by age and by name.

Add buttons for sorting.

Create a **new component** that takes persons as an input and displays them. 

When methods are implemented, unit tests should pass when you run `ng test`.

You must not edit `app.component.spec.ts` or `persons.ts` files.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.
